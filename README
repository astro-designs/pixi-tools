pixi-tools: a set of software to interface with the Raspberry Pi and
PiXi-200 hardware

The following components are included:

libpixi/
    A low level c-library.  The library is written in C99, but the headers
    are C89 compatible (except log.h, which is gnu89 compatible).

pio/
    A C program command-line interface that provides hardware access via
    libpixi.

swig/
    Generated python bindings for libpixi. The following modules are available:
    pixitools.pi
        a wrapper of the generic and Raspberry Pi related parts of libpixi
    pixitools.pixi
        a wrapper of the PiXi-200 related parts of libpixi

python/lib/
    Some additional pure python modules.

python/scripts/
    A small selection of scripts that make use of and demonstrate the
    pixitools python package:
    pixi-server:
        Provides access to Pi and PiXi hardware via a web-browser

Python versions 2.7 and >=3.2 are supported.

libpixi and pio have selectable log levels via environment variables.  Use
LIBPIXI_LOG_LEVEL=? and/or PIO_LOG_LEVEL=? where ? is one of all, trace,
debug, info, warn, error, fatal, off.  Example:

root@raspberrypi:~# pio fpga-version
210349040313
root@raspberrypi:~# LIBPIXI_LOG_LEVEL=trace pio fpga-version
pio: trace: libpixi initialised
pio: trace: Found hardware [BCM2708]
pio: trace: Found board revision [0002]
pio: trace: Setting board version to 1
pio: trace: 3 = pixi_open (filename="/dev/spidev0.0", flags=2, mode=0)
pio: debug: Opened SPI name=/dev/spidev0.0 fd=3
pio: trace: pixi_spiReadWrite of fd=3, bufferSize=4
pio: trace: pixi_spiReadWrite of fd=3, bufferSize=4
pio: trace: pixi_spiReadWrite of fd=3, bufferSize=4
pio: debug: Got PiXi FPGA version 2103,4904,0313
pio: debug: Closing SPI device fd=3
