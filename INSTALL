Building and installing pixi-tools
==================================


Dependencies
------------

GNU make is required.
A C99 compatible C compiler (any recent gcc).
swig is required for building the python bindings.
doxygen is required for generating the API Reference.


Building
--------

Invoke 'make help' for some help.

Invoke 'make'.  This will create a simple Makefile in build/release and run
the build from there.  Detected Python related build settings are hardcoded
into the generated Makefile.

You can do a debug build by instead invoking 'make BUILD_MODE=debug'.  The
build directory will be build/debug.

You can specify a python version by invoking e.g. 'make PYTHON_VERSION=3.3'.
The generated build directory name will contain the python version.

You can specify a build directory of your choice by invoking 'make
builddir=some/where/else'.

Invoke 'make doc' to run doxygen to generate the API reference html.


Checking
--------

The beginnings of a test suite exist.  You can run the tests after building
by invoking 'make check'.  Invoking 'make multi-check', will build and test
debug/release and python 2/3 configurations.


Installing
----------

If the tests pass, you can install to /usr/local by invoking 'make install'.
You can install to a different directory by invoking
'make install prefix=/somewhere/else'.  You can also use
DESTDIR=/some/staging/directory/ for a staged installation.
